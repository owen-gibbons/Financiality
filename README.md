# Financiality
This is a project I am working on to make a fully-featured finances app, where a user can add bank transactions, credit card transactions, monitor their accounts, and even specify which credit cards to use given their respective cash back bonuses. Right now, I intend on this app being fully offline to avoid any data collection, which sets it apart from many of the popular finance apps which collect all types of data. In the future, I may make a separate version that implements something like Plaid to connect bank accounts, but data collection will always be as low as possible.
